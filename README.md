# Maya

Māyā was the mother of Buddha, and her name means "illusion" in Sanskrit. We aim at developping a neuropsychological test to assess the brain's functioning at the predictive coding level using visual illusions.


## Introduction

Neuroscience is in a period of strong theorethical mutation, partly fuelled by the emergence and popularization of a framework proposing a unifying theory of the brain, namely, predictive coding (also formulated as the Bayesian Brain hypothesis, or the Free Energy Principle).
